# Computer Center Management System (CCMS)

## Project Overview

The Computer Center Management System (CCMS) makes running our computer center easier. It automates the sign-in process and gets rid of manual paperwork. With two ways to sign in—using your ID number or student card barcode—the system keeps things organized. CCMS helps staff work better and gives students a smoother experience. It replaces paper records with digital ones, making everything simpler and more efficient.

- **Comprehensive Database:** Centralized storage for student information ensures quick and accurate access, eliminating the hassle of manual record-keeping.
- **Dashboard:** Easily manage students in the computer center with the ability to add, remove (check in), and checkout students.
- **Printing Management:** Calculate printing costs based on university policies, simplifying the billing process.
- **Settings Page:** Empower administrators to adjust prices for computer center hours and printing according to university policies.
- **Employee Account Management:** Conveniently update personal information and profile pictures for enhanced user customization.
